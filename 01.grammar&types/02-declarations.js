    notes on variables:
        -a variable name must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
        -numbers may follow the above characters, but they cant come first
        -javascript is case sensitive= hello & Hello are two separate variables
        -no spaces allowed in variable name
        -camelCase-first word umdercase, second word is capitalized-best practice for naming variables
         with multiple words
         -helps with readability
